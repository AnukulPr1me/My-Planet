# My First Three.js Project

Welcome to my first Three.js project! This project is a simple 3D scene created using Three.js, a popular JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics on the web. In this scene, you'll find a basic 3D model, some interactive elements, and a beautiful rendering of 3D graphics.

## How to Clone and Run the Project

To get started with the project, follow the steps below to clone the repository and run it using npm command-line:

### Prerequisites

Before you proceed, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

1. Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager): You can download and install them from the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org/).

### Cloning the Repository

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Change the current working directory to where you want to store the project.

3. Run the following command to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```
Replace `<repository_url>` with the actual URL of your project's repository.

4. Once the cloning process is complete, change the directory to the project's root folder:

```bash
cd <project_folder>
```
Replace `<project_folder>` with the name of the folder created during the cloning process.

### Installing Dependencies

Next, you need to install the project's dependencies (such as Three.js) using npm. In the project's root folder, run:

```bash
npm install
```

This command will fetch and install all the required packages listed in the `package.json` file.

### Running the Project

With the dependencies installed, you are now ready to run the Three.js project. In the project's root folder, run the following npm command:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the development server, and you should see a message indicating that the project is running and on which port it's being served (e.g., http://localhost:3000).

### Viewing the Project

Open your web browser and enter the URL provided by the npm start command (e.g., http://localhost:3000). You should now see the Three.js project rendered in your browser.

### Interacting with the Project

Feel free to interact with the 3D scene! Depending on the complexity of your project, you might be able to navigate the scene, zoom in and out, and interact with different elements. Enjoy exploring the world of Three.js!
